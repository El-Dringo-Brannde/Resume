            {\bf Azure Engineering - Automation Engineer}  
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Currently designing a manageable way to edit \& deploy network firewall rules. Using an infrastructure as code, rules are view-able to the entire organization, and automatically deployed upon changes.  Saving the Nike network team endless man hours processing tickets for firewall exceptions, this allows engineers to submit a pull request to make the exact change they need.

            \vspace{2mm}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Developed an automated process of taking designer artwork and making it print ready. Meeting the exact specifications of the printer, saving about four hours of labor for each design that gets created. The project has since been picked up and being used by the Nike By You (Nike iD) team.
                \vspace{1mm}
                \item Designed \& implemented a ReactJS/Mobx website to create a new classified method of making shoes. The website served as a front end to program a manufacturing machine, that used a custom file format. While at the same time abstracting all the technicalities so that more Nike engineers can use the machine.

            \vspace{2mm}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Audited the termination process of Nike Employees, automating a full days worth of work into a minute long Python script. This ensured that Nike employees that had been terminated, had their access revoked in a single day from up to a month to prevent access from any potentially disgruntled employees.
                \vspace{1mm}
                
                \item Automated how Corporate Information Security blacklists/whitelists IP addresses. Unifying to a single source of truth of what IP address ranges are safe or not, making it both easily accessible and maintainable.

            \begin{itemize}

Such that leadership can better estimate when a product should be released to minimize bugs \& maximize developer efficiency. Using a custom data pipeline powered by Python and Machine Learning to predict what projects were at risk based off of JIRA data.

            \item Built the complete frontend, backend, and automation scripts that power predictionstrike.com. A sports betting website that has transacted over \$300k where we see athletes like stocks and adjust their price with their in-game performance. Designed the backend architecture with Azure Functions using NodeJS, the frontend with ReactJS \& NextJS. A custom ETL pipeline to update game data with Python, bundled all with Docker and deployed using Azure Devops in a CI/CD manner.

            \vspace{1mm}
            
            \item Developed the logic that allows ETWs to shop on The Van, growing the customer base by 60\%. Along with the growing day-to-day sales by an average of over 100\% with the new user base. 
            
            \vspace{1mm}

Which allows developers to run middleware to deal with validation, authentication, and authorization, prior to their serverless logic being ran. Downloaded over 600 times.
